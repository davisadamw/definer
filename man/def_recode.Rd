\title{Recode a single vector or return vector unchanged}
\usage{
def_recode(.x, definitions, .default = NULL, .missing = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{.x}{A vector to modify}

\item{definitions}{A named vector or named list of replacement values, probably one entry in a dictionary
produced by \code{\link{def_prep}()}. If this explicitly passed \code{null}, \code{.x} will be returned as is}

\item{.default}{If supplied, all values not otherwise matched will be given this value.
   If not supplied and if the replacements are the same type as the original values in .x,
   unmatched values are not changed. If not supplied and if the replacements are not compatible,
   unmatched values are replaced with NA.

   .default must be either length 1 or the same length as .x.}

\item{.missing}{If supplied, any missing values in .x will be replaced by this value. Must be either
length 1 or the same length as .x.}
}
\value{
Vector of same length and order as \code{.x}, but with values drawn from \code{definitions}
}
\description{
Replaces numeric or character values in \code{vector} with matching entries from a named
vector or list provided in \code{definitions}.
}
\details{
This function is essentially equivalent to running \code{dplyr::\link[dplyr]{recode}(.x, !!!definitions)} but
returns the original values if it is called with an empty definitions set.
